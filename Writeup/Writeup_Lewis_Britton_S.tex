	\begin{abstract}
		This piece extensively details and provides context to all components of the system I've developed for this project: \textit{Burning Roots}. The system explores the context of the system, being the Scottish highlands; it's landmasses and their routes, with additional components such as ability factors, equipment (`gear') factors and the contribution of weather. The system is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript; uses JSON data store for high-level querying; implements GPX files using the GPX-to-GeoJSON method; uses user-specific location services through the Geolocation API; accesses weather data using the OpenWeather API; and present the user with an interactive map, based on these factors, using the Ordnance Survey API and Leaflet. Post-completion of the system, this piece details all elements of the software development process which have been practiced, including: requirement gathering; development environments; the user interface logic and design; data storage and use; continuous prototyping; continuous test-driven development; user testing; and accessibility and usability factors. It finds that opportunities taken, with reference to the selected languages, APIs and libraries, etc., efficient routes are selected and client criteria are successfully met, although there remains adequate room for expansion and improvement given the nature of the scripting; how functions are written and interlink, etc.

	This document’s presentation reflects the use of {\LaTeX} typesetting (Figure B1), using Computer Modern Unicode (Figure B2). Unfortunately {\TeX}\ does not support the required selection of packages for this project, such as \texttt{tikz} and various code markup and math packages. Hence, PDFs are produced using the (PDF){\LaTeX}\ compiler, although (\textsc{Xe}){\LaTeX}\ could have been useful in places. Due to time constraints, I've not been able to master the fine art of GNU Troff, so transcriptions will not be blessed by the Groff-PostScript combo. Processes such as these help escape the inane formatting requirements of my institution. References are presented using \textsc{Bib}{\TeX}, favouring \textsl{oblique} over \textit{italic}, in-line with Donald E. Knuth’s preference (Knuth, 2020). The process is executed in command line using a newer version of Emperor Moolenaar's Vim (Moolenaar, 2020), neoVim, which is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to explain in a tutor such as this. It yields the `Full Vi Experience' (Vim Diesel, 2020). For maximum optical pleasure, such alike a photo of Lily Collins, the use of Zathura (not M$\mu$PDF!) is vigorously advised, with inversion (not sandwich).

\section{Introduction}\label{ch1}

	\subsection{Purpose \& Industry}

	This system is a web application which provides user-location-based and external GPS data, based on the user's machine and external. The system, which so forth may be referred to as `the system', `the application', `the site', provides detailed information, guidance and recommendations relevant to sport and leisure, particularly hiking, in Scotland's fine rural outdoors. A full version of this system would be comparable to services such as Walkhighlands, Strava, and Garmin Connect.

	\subsection{System Structure}

	This system is not static, not dynamic, meaning requests made buy the user are based on existing data. The site does not reference an external database. Hence; no PHP or SQL-relevant content.\\

	The `home'/`Drafting' page displays an overview of features, such as mountain and route summaries, `ability' and `equipment'-based factors, and weather forecasting. The `Conquest' page allows the user to interact with various GPS and mapping features including location services. It also includes various static features such as feature pinpointing (Munros, Munro Tops, Corbetts, Corbett Tops, etc.), and GPX route seeking/printing. The service is called `Burning Roots' (Figure B3)\\

	\subsection{Users \& Platforms}

	All users are sport/leisure-oriented specifically, athletes who are already hiking-inclined. It may encourage new hikers due to the informative nature and customization opportunity. The system was originally planned to include road cycling features however upon reflection, this element is irrelevant as: [1] all functional areas are covered by the computational processes involved with hiking data; and [2] road cycling has little association with hiking. If it were to be included, it would be more logical to implement with a wider array of sports. In this context, it's inclusion would lead to diminishing returns due to time constraint.\\

	The user arrives at this site through a web browser. This system is deployed as a website and is therefore extremely versatile and usable on any device. Browser caching of script elements allows a user to view and interact with the relevant data offline, provided they receive GPS signal; providing benefit when in-the-field. This means that the site is constructed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

	\subsection{Development Process}

	As this is a solo project, there is little requirement for extensive use of formal coordination frameworks. Therefore, any adherence to processes aimed at mapping management of this project are logic-oriented/variable, allowing creative freedom.\\

	Following acquisition of user requirements, the most important element is determination of user interaction. That is, what inputs must be provided, how these will be used to satisfy requirements while remaining relevant. Therefore, the functional structuring of the user interface (UI) demonstrates the necessary logic for this basic planning. So forth, the development process follows:

		$\rightarrow$ Testing\\
		\hline
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
		\caption{Development Process}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}

	At this starting point, data accounts for non-user-centered features such as GPS coordinates, landmasses and their attributes, etc.; essential for the majority of computations. Therefore, JavaScript is also implemented to compute based on data in developer-made JSON files. It's after this when non-crucial elements, such as graphic design, are allocated more focus. Incremental developer tests follow this.\\

	For the natural ease in workflow, all files (including `code', data files, notes and write-up) are composed and performed in Bram Moolenaar's neoVi Improved, in the command line of a dwm setup on Artix. HTML, CSS and JavaScript is written from scratch in plain text format in order to maintain a practical process. All write-up documentation is transcribed using Don. E. Knuth's \TeX.

\section{Research \& Evidential Background}\label{ch2}

	\subsection{Areas of Exploration}

	This system is designed to combine and present aspects of the different types hiking routes and their attributes; the recommended/available equipment; the personal fitness and ability level of users; and, the geography and geology related to routes.

		\subsubsection{Hiking Routes}

		Hiking routes are the foundation of the system. They provide reason to the GPS aspect. There are various demonstrations of how hiking routes are implemented in different ways across slightly different platforms. Walkhighlands for example, presents very static use of these; displaying a page per routes listing manually expressed data and literature. Each route cannot be interacted with and has no dynamic attributes. In this system, GPS routes are made dynamically relevant to the user.

		\subsubsection{Hiking Equipment}

		Many routes require particular components and combinations of equipment, including the appropriate knowledge of such. This means it's necessary that hikers are as aware of the precautions and hazards present on routes. Including a metric which accounts for the user's equipment, alongside relevant literature, ensures that this site takes the implements the correct protocol to see that users don't make unrealistic inference. In existing services such as Strava and Garmin Connect, there are not metrics which account for these attributes. Within Walkhighlands, there is plenty of literature available however, this information is not quantified.

		\subsubsection{Personal Fitness \& Ability}

		Understanding of kinematics and dynamics of the human body, keeping the heart regulated, correctly distributing force and converting torque all must be quantified in such a way which reflects a user's expected effort and ability to complete a route. Again, route planners such as Walkhighlands do not offer any form of input using these metrics. Strava and Garmin Connect do however, only offer them as output estimates.\\

		\subsubsection{Geography}

		The use of geography within this system is fairly static and informational. It's attributes cannot be used as inputs which determine future results. As physical geography is out of the control of user's however, there wouldn't be much use in quantifying it. It is however useful if users have an understanding of what geographical features are and how they can have an impact on their routes. This feature is irrelevant to Strava and Garmin Connect and is therefore not included. Walkhighlands includes excellent educational sources however there's not much continuity and consistency to their presence.

	\subsection{Material Investigation \& Heuristic Evaluations}

	As an inexperienced sole developer, improvements upon existing services aren't based on functionality and code efficiency etc.; they're focused on making a few particular features more relevant, accessible and usable. So forth, existing services are examined purely under the scope of this system.\\

	As an alternative to empirical methodologies, Nielsen (1994) proposes a critique-based method based on a heuristic evaluation which involves analysis based on areas of expertise. A heuristic evaluation of one's own system is also argued to be a useful method of allocating time to minor issues before final user testing. Nielsen also claims that the optimal number of `experts' assigned to an evaluation is three-to-five in order to find the `optimal' number of issues relative to the cost-benefit analysis. In this case however, one examiner is used for obvious reasons. Each issue is valued against the set of heuristic factors seen in the below table. There's no evaluation of Garmin Connect as it's functionality doesn't differ much from that of Strava.

\section{System Requirements}\label{ch3}

	Requirements gathering aligns the concept of system functionality with real-world desires. Although the creator of a system may have a clear vision of the intended outcome, understanding what users need/want allows the creator to constantly tailor development to how they and/or the software could/should gather information, store data, transact data, and output data/information.

	\subsection{Scale \& Scope}

	If this system were to be designed by a team of professionals, it would offer much expansible functionality. However, due to personnel, time, and budget constraints, the system finds two general down-scales: [1] there is no user-data back-end, meaning user accounts are unavailable on this system, which is acceptable as the static functionality of the site is most relevant; and, [2] the sample region for data collection is significantly smaller than that offered by other services, which is also acceptable as adding a wider scope of data (to the master JSON in this case) would only consist of repeating the same patterns perpetually.\\

	In an ideal world, users would be able to expand their scope of interactions within the system. That is, different sports with a wider and varying array of attributes. This means as sports differ, attributes and statistics differ, and information and guidance differs; offering a better-rounded service. The decision to disregard user accounts keeps the system and implementation of requirements more manageable and makes it easier to achieve a better product within constraints. 

	\subsection{Gathering \& Prioritization Methodology}

	There are three methods of requirements gathering here: [1] purely user-centered method, from my personal surroundings filled with people who share an interest in this context, including professional/student developers, they act as an accurate representation of market users; [2] (subject to contextual bias) creative direction explicitly from myself as I'm experienced in this context; [3] basic inference from investigation of Walkhighlands, Strava and Garmin Connect which generally doesn't require user-centered input and is interpreted functionally. Purely objective/functional requirements are represented by the latter of these methods. The former two account for desired improvements upon existing material. There's no formal client base so no official client-oriented interviews.

	To better-address importance/relevance, requirements are analysed using the hierarchical Must-Have/Should-Have/Could-Have/Won't-Have (MoSCoW) methodology. This differentiates between essential functionality for system practicality, and optimization-based functionality. This approach reflects functional requirements averaging top-priority, and non-functional requirements distributed lower. The table below maps this framework.

	\begin{table}[h]
		\scriptsize
		\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{r|p{11cm}}
		\hline
		\hline
		\textsc{Must-Have} & Implementations refer to aspects of the system which must be present in order to make it basically functional and behave as it is intended and as the user desires.\\
		\textsc{Should-Have} & Implementations refer to features of the system which should be implemented in order to make the essential features of the system more accessible and useable to the masses. They may also exist to improve efficiency and therefore go unnoticed by the user. They may offer additional functionality which makes the system more unique (or something of the sort) and therefore, more `creative' and attractive to users.\\
		\textsc{Could-Have} & Implementations refer to aspects which may become present or relevant during the development of the former two. They may add additional functionality or usability to existing aspects or simply add final touches to the system overall. They are sometimes more contemporary.\\
		\textsc{Won't Have} & Non-implementations refer to aspects of the system which aren't necessarily impossible or are of a nature which the system `can't have' but, which will probably be omitted or postponed due to constraints such as time, man-power, technical ability, finance, etc.\\
		\hline
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
		\caption{MoSCoW Methodology}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}

\newpage

	\subsection{Requirements}

	Differentiation between essential functionality for the system foundations (\textit{functional requirements}); and more-contemporary functionality (\textit{non-functional requirements}) is often considered ``making things \textit{work} and making things \textit{relevant}''. It also allows deduction of element associations of the design and construction.

		\subsubsection{Requirements Satisfaction}

	Requirements are presented in a numeric format with no hierarchical order, it simply creates a reference point for user stories. Hierarchy remains determined by the MoSCoW methodology. It's not exhaustive; there's always room for perpetual development.

		\subsubsection{User Stories}

	`User stories' contextualize requirements and present how they can be interpreted by the final user. This delivers feedback on how to apply a solution to a requirement. It also identifies possible negations and irrelevant content. The user stories in Figure A3 follows the syntax: ``I wish to be able to $<$interact\_with\_feature$>$ in anticipation of $<$returned\_result$>$ which will provide me with $<$payoff$>$''.

	\subsection{User Accessibility}

	This system could be accessed by anyone with internet access. Therefore, it's essential that users of all types are welcomed to the site, even if they have no prior knowledge of the field. More importantly, user interface should be accommodating of users with possible imparities by taking a user-centered approach which considers visible accessibility controls which allow users to interface with the system easily. Accessibility extends to clean and concise CSS and graphic design for simple and intuitive navigation and relevance, etc. These approaches are widely considered/implemented and discussed further subsequently.\\

\section{Data Gathering}\label{ch4}

	\subsection{Data}

	A program has no context without the applicable data. Data is required to present the base functionality and content related to many features. Figure A4 details an overview of all data sources, purposes and uses throughout every component of this system, which are discussed here.

		\subsubsection{Location}

	Once a call to \verb|navigator.geolocation| has been made, which interfaces with the browser, the user is prompted to grant access to device location services. Once this is confirmed, GPS data is easily accessible. Two critical values captured using Geolocation are latitude and longitude, which are used to: [1] \verb|Geolocation.getCurrentPosition()| for various calculations such as distance measure; and [2], \verb|Geolocation.watchPosition()| for continuous location tracking.

		\subsubsection{Regional}

	This refers to GPS coordinates of [1] Scottish counties, [2] Scottish regions, [3] Scottish sub-regions, and [4] all sub-sub-regions of Scotland. For example, \textit{Moray} is a County; \textit{Glenfinnan} is a sub-sub-region, in the sub-region \textit{Fort William, Lochaber and Lorn}, in the region \textit{Highlands}. This is acquired by inspecting the `Search all walks' section of Walkhighlands (Walkhighlands, 2022), although did require amendments. It's stored in a local JSON file and hosted on my GitHub. Regions are ordered south-to-north.

		\subsubsection{Landmass}

	This is alike, in that is stores records of GPS coordinate data upon the landmasses of Scotland. It also includes data on landmasses themselves, which are anything resembling some significant land-form of Scotland. A landmass may either be a \textit{Mountain}, \textit{Mountain Range}, or \textit{Stand Alone}. A mountain is a single prominent feature which contains one or more hills without a contour drop under 2000ft between summits; a mountain range is a group of prominent features which contain hills without a contour drop under 1200ft between summits; and, a stand alone is a single prominent feature which contains one hill. `Hill' refers to \textit{Munros} and \textit{Corbetts}, not \textit{Munro/Corbett Tops}. See Figure A4.\\

	Data is gathered manually by myself through OS Explorer 376\footnote{Oban \& North Lorn (Figure B4)}, Explorer 377\footnote{Loch Etive \& Glen Orchy} and Explorer 384\footnote{Glen Coe \& Glen Etive}. This provides access to information not yet recorded. Reference to Walkhighlands, Harold Street (2022), and Peakbagger.com (2022) was made to ensure full-inclusion of community-driven data. Data is stored in the JSON file. Landmasses are ordered south-to-north. Under constraints, some omissions/amendments and notes were made as detailed in the below table.

	\begin{table}[h]
		\scriptsize
		\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{r|p{12cm}}
		\hline
		\hline
		1 & The sample size is limited to the South-West Highlands, which refers to the region spanning Glen Etive, Glen Orchy and Glen Coe, a.k.a. the land between the A85 to Oban and the A82 through Glen Orchy, through Glen Coe, to Ballachullish (side note: don't confuse `Glen Coe' with `Glencoe' in the context of this data! Critical Errors will occur. Glencoe is the village, Glen Coe is the glen. And we aren't Mr. Walkhighlands so it isn't `Glinco')\\
		2 & Sub2000s, Donalds, Grahams and Grahams tops do not appear in the data as this would have taken an inappropriate amount of time to collect and the six-thousand-line JSON was enough already\\
		3 & Some details for Corbett Tops and Munro Tops, are not provided as even the most of the aforementioned `detailed' sites were lacking some data\\
		4 & Munros, Munro Tops, Corbetts and Corbett Tops are ordered primarily by category and secondarily from max elevation highest-to-lowest within their category\\
		5 & There is no pre-determined `order' to Corrie hierarchy on landmasses so they are simply ordered by myself from south-to-north\\
		6 & Ideally, Corries, Gullies, Lochains and Waterfalls would be named and assigned GPS coordinates in the JSON file. However, OS maps were too inconsistent with naming the features so only the 100\% consistent Corrie category is given this luxury. Others are simply assigned boolean values\\
		7 & HTML symbols such as \`{o} (\verb|&ograve;|) and \^{e} (\verb|&ecric;|), which appear frequently in Gaelic spellings, are unfortunately not favoured in the JSON or any other iteration of the relevant words, as much time is saved developing functions and methods to search; loop through and match the data\\
		\hline
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
		\caption{Omissions/Amendments \& Notes}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}

		\subsubsection{Route}

	Route attributes appear as a component of a landmass; ``a route on a landmass''. Route data is gathered from Walkhighlands, in a combination of official Walkhighlands routes, community-contributed Walkhighlands routes, and my personal \href{https://www.strava.com/athlete/training}{Strava}. Another component of a route is it's GPS data. Global Positioning System Exchange Format (GPS Exchange Format (GPX)) is the most commonly used file type to store GPS data uploaded to Walkhighlands and Strava. These files are selected from the same three sources. JavaScript operates using a GeoJSON format therefore, GPX is converted. As routes are landmasses components, they also occur south-to-north.

		\subsubsection{Ability}

	Ability data is manufactured by myself relative to variations in peoples' interact with landmasses' routes. It offers characteristics relating to numerical difficulties of routes. Included also are various strings describing these aspects and their purposes. There isn't necessarily a data source in this case, apart from my endless hours in the Scottish Highlands. This too is part of the JSON file. See Figure A4.

		\subsubsection{Equipment}

	Equipment data follows; it's manufactured by myself and refers to a list of industry/field-available equipment. It's constructed of basic strings describing the good and it's purpose. The only source is my countless hours browsing Tiso and talking to other enthusiasts. This is pat of the JSON file. See Figure A4.

		\subsubsection{Weather}

	Weather data would be unrealistically manually gathered from the Met Office for example so, OpenWeather (OpenWeather 2022) is used, which offers a comprehensive API covering all the relevant locations to this system. This data originates from the OpenWeather One Call API, which provides a wide selection of minutely, hourly and daily data.

	\subsection{Information}

	In the context of output of this data, sometimes the limited parameters within which it can be presented are too restrictive. Ongoing research is conducted into each of the elements to provide additional nominal guidance. This must be appropriately applied by the user to make it relevant to their engagements. This process is continuously added to throughout the lifespan of the system and is therefore never complete.

\newpage

\section{System Design}\label{ch5}

	\subsection{System Architecture \& Concept}

	Through a relevant front-end, users communicate through various input methods and requests to communicate with and manipulate data for a contextualized and beneficial output. That is, data which is displayed in an informative manner which can aid experience in the real-world-context of the system. This strictly adheres to requirements and functionality.\\

	After consideration of the tangibility, feasibility and relevance of requirements, understanding how to most efficiently allow users to interact with these elements is the most crucial component. Therefore, the most logical approach to design is user interface experimentation. This highlights what data is relevant to requirements and functionality. After dataset gathering, the system takes a comprehensive approach while using the least amount of UI real estate / code. This is reflected in the efficient two-page site this system offers.\\

	The system was originally intended to include three pages, the third being `Ranger'; a series of user-input-based and pre-defined graphing functions based on the Chart.js (Chart.js, 2022) JavaScript library. This was omitted due to time constraints and lack of relevance to the brief. So forth, this stage involves fast prototyping, continuous developer/user practical and command line testing, and rapid change. Given time, technical and financial constraints, the correct protocol was executed.

	\subsection{User Interface}

		\subsubsection{Logical Design}

	This system is based on choice and is therefore inclusive of all aspects of demographics ranging from age groups, personalities, genders, races, etc., who have a passion to practice or learn about the Scottish Highlands. This implies that the system must be as widely available as possible, meaning it should: [1] be capable of supporting the user's choice of media such as their web browser, and [2] be available on the user's choice of (desktop/mobile) device which is accessible at home and in the field.\\

	Hence, web-based application. With JavaScript delivering the required `functionality', HTML delivering pure-functionality, and CSS delivering engagement and interactiveness. Thus, the desktop site is intended for planning stages, and the mobile site is intended for navigational/safety in the field. Given zero-constraints, the system could be developed as a full mobile and application as well as in-browser, in which GPS features could be used offline as many user's may find themselves lacking internet connection in the field.

		\subsubsection{Logic Tree}

	The following recursion tree details paths through the interface. The tree's nodes don't exhaust listing of functions however, they do exhaust listing of the UI's element-interaction with functions. The hierarchical structure of these pages provide versatile functionality. The system doesn't perfectly fit the definition of `object oriented' although it heavily relies on JavaScript. Therefore, a navigation map is a more logical demonstration than a use case diagram.

		\subsubsection{Graphic Design \& Communication}

	Graphic design is often overlooked, especially small-scale developments with lacking specialization in artistic practices. All graphic design is crafted in-house using CSS, desktop publishing (DTP) and photo manipulation software such as GIMP and Serif Page Plus for additional content. Elements and principals of graphic design are adhered-to to represent aspects of associated landscapes and dynamics.

			\paragraph{Cascading Stylesheet (CSS)}

	CSS serves to: [1] make the site relevant/contextualized, and [2] make it accessible. Examples of this application of these are detailed in the below table.

	\begin{table}[h]
		\scriptsize
		\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l|p{10cm}}
		\textsc{Elements/Principals} & \textsc{Application}\\
		\hline
		\hline
		Color, Emphasis & Make the surrounding foreground of the site pop in a manner such as that of a mid-2000's military briefing room. That background remains shades of whites and the foreground shades of grey, which also allows the natural colors of the OS map and other features alike to be further and more easily viewed\\
		Depth, Motion & Gradients were used in appropriate places to continue the theme of fast-motion\\
		Movement, Motion & The logo enters the site with fast movement in an animation from left to right, highlighting elements of motion\\
		\hline
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
		\caption{Elements \& Principals of Graphic Design}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}

	Fonts play a similar role in theme relevance. Packages include Sans-Serif \textit{NFS} and \textit{Audi Type Variable}, Audi's famous typeface, which add a modern `sporty' feel to a service which traditionally projects itself using GaramondEB and no styling. Both of these fonts are detailed in Figure 5.1.

	\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{subfigure}[t]{8cm}
                \begin{center}
                        \includegraphics[width=7.5cm,height=1cm]{../System/Photos/nfs.png}
                \end{center}
                        \caption{NFS Typeface}
                \end{subfigure}
                \begin{subfigure}[t]{5cm}
                \begin{center}
                        \includegraphics[width=4.5cm,height=3cm]{../System/Photos/audi.png}
                \end{center}
                        \caption{Audi Type Variable Typeface}
                \end{subfigure}
	\end{center}
	\end{figure}

	FontAwesome (FontAwesome, 2021) is used in simplifying the user experience by implementing recognizable and relatable symbols in places where text would create too much bloat. This also aids accessibility and improves navigation efficiency. Common uses include: location, maps, map features, weather features, personal features, and equipment.\\ 

	Hue, saturation and luminance are all appropriately assigned values to elements of the design to allow optimal readability and minimal strain. It is always recommended that a user adjusts the gamma output of their display accordingly however, blue-light-emitting ratios are kept minimal. Improvement can always be made, including JavaScript functionality which allows the user to control the font size, colors, element sizes, etc. Given the constraints and brief, the time-reward trade-off was not valuable.

			\paragraph{Desktop Publishing (DTP)}

	This is a non-required portion; the promotional piece is out-of-date and irrelevant however, is displayed in Figure A5 for your leisure. Note, some additional graphic design features are omitted due to constraints/relevance. For example, map symbols were all intended to be custom designs, however FontAwesome was favoured instead.

			\paragraph{Photo Manipulation}

	The primary use of GIMP is to design an appropriate logo to-be advertised throughout the site, relating closely to it's themes. This is seen in Figure 5.2. graphic design justification is detailed in the succeeding table.

		Color (red), Emphasis & In the `burning' word to \textit{harmonize} with the word's semantic definition and emphasise the `burning desire'\\
		Reverse, Emphasis & A reverse-distress overlay (grunge effect) is used on the `roots' word to emphasise the diverse combination of `worn', `distressed', `fatigued', `excited' and `accomplished' emotions experienced by the user in the field. This process is shown above in Figure 5.3\\

		\subsubsection{Use Cases}

	A use case diagram is irrelevant given the context and structure of the following portions of this report. It would be nugatory. Hence, referring to all headings under the following \textit{Data Application \& Manipulation} section, the data overview in Figure A4, and functions detailed in Figure A6; use cases involving each function's relevance can be deduced from this content.

	\subsection{Data Application \& Manipulation}

	All data discussed in Section 4 of this report is included through functions and others methods, producing desired outcomes which satisfy user requirements. A summary of this process is seen in Figure A6. Reference to data is detailed in Figure A4.

		\subsubsection{`Overview'}

	The `Overview' portion of the home page refers to a more basic iteration of the route search and landmass search functions, seen subsequently in the `Conquest Map'. For the sake of continuity, all basic features of these functions' use of data is discussed under this heading; additional data required for the `Conquest Map' versions are discussed latterly.

			\paragraph{Score Route}

	This function serves the \textit{Search Route} function. This metric is constantly under development as more/greater ideas are generated. It's still very subjective; based on my own and others' experiences. Therefore, the `score' is not a definitive metric to describe the condition of a route, it should be considered on an individual basis.\\

	Scoring a route accounts [1] four groups of subjective scores based on weights and values of the four route element factors in the JSON file, and [2] a more objective multiplier based on total number of tops on-route, the total elevation gained, and the total distance covered. Actual values of weights are gathered through personal field practice and are therefore subject to bias and continuous adjustment. The multiplier is developed purely by myself. The imperial system is used therefore, as this computation calls mathematical scalability, conversion constants are required for elevation and distance. These are justified to four significant figures. The relevant mathematical notation is detailed in Figure B5. All parameters follow in the below table.

	Given project constraints, some restrictions are applied as follow in the below table.

		1 & Writing the score route function would be too-lengthy-a-process if calculating the score of each of the four route elements based on the individual values of the 5, 4, 11 and 20 sub-elements respectively using the factorial method, so the latter 3 are calculated simply by volume/variety. This does not accurately reflect the difficulty of terrain for example as a route with grass and concrete will be considered more difficult than a route with grade 3 slab, simply because it has one more element. In this context it doesn't matter too much as the math has been demonstrated successfully however.\\
		2 & If using the exhaustive method, volume is accounted for by the inclusion and exclusion of values which, if all-inclusive, should add up to N sub-elements in that group. But this is rare.\\
		3 & All four of the route elements do not include consistent examinations of their sub-elements (value ($V_{i,j,k,l}$)) when scoring a route. That is, for example using the route type array, sub-element $i=1$ and $i=5$ may not be examined together if they do not appear as a combination in the JSON file and therefore don't critically need to be examined. Equally, in the route stage array, perhaps sub-element $j=3$ isn't examined soley because it doesn't appear on its own in the JSON file. In a perfect world, every combination and isolation would be examined however, with the time allocated here, it is not worth the effort.\\

	\end{center}
	\end{table}

			\paragraph{Describe Route Score}

	This is used to evaluate the meaning of the given route score and translate it into more human-understandable terms. It's based on increments including: 0-33.\.{3}: ``Playground (Amateur)''; 34--66.\.{6}: ``Normie (Easy)''; 67--100: ``Trad (Moderate)''; 100+: ``GigaChad (Challenging)''. It gives the user a better indication of what ability routes requires from.

			\paragraph{Search Route}

	This searches JSON (Figure A4) for data under a \texttt{landmass} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{route} for a match with input from \texttt{select} which allows users to select from routes matching those with names in the JSON file. This process could be executed using text \texttt{input} however, relies on the user having pre-existing knowledge of routes, and removes from the comprehensiveness/inclusiveness of viewing all possibilities. This function outputs a body of text which displays attributes of routes in a human-readable context. This is the fasted method I have witnessed from landing on a site to being able to access a route, download it and use it.

			\paragraph{Search Landmass}

	This searches JSON (Figure A4) for data under a \texttt{landmass} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{munro}, \texttt{munrotop}, \texttt{corbe- tttop} or \texttt{corbett} for a match with input from \texttt{input} which allows users to choose their desired hill. Landmasses are looped until a Munro, Munro Top, Corbett or Corbett Top name is matched with input. Note: search criteria doesn't have to be character-matching, case-matching or syntactically correct as JavaScript protocol ensures more `loose' data matching; and, [2] if there are multiple matches under a user input, results are prioritized firstly by landmass appearance in the JSON file (south-to-north (majority of users will live south of the highlands)), and secondly by hierarchy of peak (Munro, `Top, Corbett, `Top). This function outputs a body of text which displays attributes of hills and the landmasses on which they appear, in a human-readable context.

		\subsubsection{`Conditioning'}

	The `Conditioning' portion of the home page allows [1] viewing of `Ability' attribute, and [2] of `Equipment' attributes. This is a simplified version of what the user uses ability and equipment data for in the `Conquest Map'.

			\paragraph{Search `Ability' \& `Equipment'}

	A \texttt{select} allows users to choose an \texttt{option} based on which set of ability/equipment factors they wish to inspect, which generates a second \texttt{select} protocol that displays the individual factors under each heading. Upon select, elements are matched by looping through the JSON file and a body of text is generated, summarizing the attributes.
	
		\subsubsection{`Weather'}

	Fetching weather data to use only requires latitude and longitude values. This creates huge opportunity to relate these parameters to many different variables therefore, many scenarios. There are four methods of inputting these: [1] \texttt{select} which list Munros, Corbetts and regions, and loop the JSON file for their latitude and longitude attributes; [2] \texttt{input} search to search loosely for names of Munros and Corbetts in the JSON file; [3] use Geolocation to fetch current device coordinates; [4] manually \texttt{input} latitude and longitude values. This is possible as the script takes \texttt{innerHTML} values directly from these input for any of these scenarios.\\

	Most data fetched using the OpenWeather API is displayed directly on the UI by string, symbol and/or CSS design to contextualize them. However, some components such as [1] the day and time (daily and hourly), [2] sunrise time, [3] sunset time, [4] precipitation (daily and hourly) and [5] visibility which require arithmetic/JavaScript to be presentable. There are also several components which do not exist as part of OpenWeather API and require more complex computations based on aspects of the API. These include [1] reassigning custom icon values; [2] assigning string descriptions of wind direction\footnote{The direction \textit{from} which the wind is travelling (originates)} at different angular intervals\footnote{Note there are no precise-enough sources supplying these intervals so much effort with a calculator was devoted}; and, [3] assigning an arrow symbol and computing a CSS angular rotation value relative to the wind direction. This symbol is provided by the Version 5 FontAwesome Free Library (FontAwesome, 2021). Demonstrations follow in the below table. The four basic computations appear in Figure A4. These also include various CSS arithmetic. For example, to color the background of the temperature section at different increments.

		\subsubsection{`Conquest' Map}

	The `Conquest Map' uses the Ordnance Survey Leisure Map API (OS API) (Ordnance Survey, 2022) to display a base map, along with other JavaScript features such as use of the Leaflet (Leaflet, 2022) library and others noted in the \textit{System Construction} section, upon which data is processed and displayed.

			\paragraph{Change Map Layer}

	Three-option \texttt{radio} input providing the option to fetch three different sets of base map layer data from the OS API: `Leisure', `Road', `Outdoor'. These are the three most relevant topographical maps to the data displayed.

			\paragraph{Show Current Location \& Find Nearest}

	Two \texttt{button}s are call functions that display the current location of the user's device and find the nearest hill to the user. The first of these uses the Geolocation API to and a function which outputs the user's location by centering the map crosshair to the coordinates, displaying a marker upon this location, and calculating/presenting an accuracy/tolerance radius. Finding the nearest hill fetches the user's coordinates using Geolocation and uses a function which accounts all route coordinates in the JSON file (Figure A4) and calculates their distance form the current coordinates. It then displays a hill as standard. See section 5.3.4.8

			\paragraph{Show \& Hide Features}

	Five \texttt{button}s call functions that display markers for all Munros, Munro Tops, Corbetts, Corbett Tops, and hide all markers, respectively. They loop the JSON file to fetch latitude and longitude of all iterations of either Munro, 'Top, Corbett, 'Top. A Leaflet marker for every hill relevant to the button selected is created, with a bound Leaflet pop-up that displays various hill attributes from the JSON file, upon click. The `hide' function loops through the array used to store the markers upon creation and removes their layers from the map.

			\paragraph{Filter Routes By `Ability' \& `Equipment'}

	See section 5.3.2.1 first. The user uses \texttt{select} protocol to add attributes to an array.  This array represents features which they wish a route to include. Values of this array (elements of ability and equipment) are matched with routes in the JSON file. Once the request is submitted, all routes which either contain these attributes are located in the JSON file, and names of these routes are displayed accordingly. Given less constraint, an additional function would be developed which could be used as part of \texttt{button}s listing these routes, instead of plain text, which would display the route directly.

			\paragraph{Score Route}

	See section 5.3.1.1. No attributes differ.

			\paragraph{Describe Route Score}

	See section 5.3.1.2. No attributes differ.

			\paragraph{Search Route}

	See section 5.3.1.3 for the breakdown of this component. There are additional features implemented in this function, in the relevance of the `Conquest Map'. The user is presented now with four options instead of just the original `summary' option under `Overview'. They are: [1] present a summary of the route as detailed in section 5.3.1.3, [2] print the route, [3] hide all routes, and [4] begin a `\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvaldKgWGHo}{Galactic Conquest}'.\\

	The print route function essentially uses the same data from the JSON file as the summary function however, it uses the GPX suffix attribute of the selected route to match with an appropriate prefix. The file matching this path is then fetched and loaded by the function using the GPX to GeoJSON method, as this is a more appropriate use in JavaScript. This GPX data is then printed on the map. Secondly, the function calls another function discussed earlier which prints a route (Leaflet) marker. This marker contains a bound Leaflet pop-up which, upon click, displays variations of data displayed in the original route search output. Finally, the function also makes calls to other functions to which attributes names of hills appearing on the route are relayed and appropriate Leaflet markers are displayed. These functions behave similarly to those discussed in section 5.3.4.2, except this time they do not print all of the Munro, `Top, Corbett and `Top markers, they just print the relevant ones.\\

	The hide all routes function acts much like the hide the function used to hide all hill markers. It simply loops through the array used to store the routes upon creation and removes their relative layer from the map. This includes all of the route markers, lines and hill markers. The fourth and final option, `Galactic Conquest' is a meme which simply loops through the entire JSON file, collects every GPX attribute suffix, matches with the appropriate prefix, and prints them on the map with the appropriate route markers, lines and hill markers.

			\paragraph{Search Landmass}	

	See section 5.3.1.4 for the breakdown of this component. There are additional features implemented in this function, in the relevance of the `Conquest Map'. As well as printing the body of text with the summary of all the attributes like before, this function also uses the \texttt{lat} and \texttt{lon} attributes of the hill firstly to input into another function which calculates the hill's distance from the user's current location and display this as part of the body-text output; and secondly, to center the map crosshair to the hill's location; and, calls a function which creates a single hill marker for the appropriate hill. This marker follows the same structure as those detailed in sections 5.3.4.4 and 5.3.4.7, except this time it prints only the single relevant Munro, `Top, Corbett or `Top.

	The following directory tree in Figure 6.4 maps the comprehensive structure of this system. Lower-tier files under `Audi' font, `aonach\_eagach' GPX, `udlaidh\_bhreac-liath' GPX and Leaflet images are omitted. However, directories are exhausted although they do include floating values denoted by ellipses (...) from $1$ to $N$ in their respective list. It of course does not include documentation such as this report.

		\subsubsection{Development Environment}

	Throughout this development process, there appears no use of any proprietary software as it remains an unreliable, unnecessary, expensive and bloated method of completing tasks. Especially those which may be executed using, for example, one command in the command line or in Vim; or, a set of processes which may be executed more efficiently using, for example, a widely applicable Vim command. Using [free and open source software] such as the operating system ([Artix Linux]), environment (command line / Vim), APIs and libraries significantly increases freedom and extensibility of the project. Hence, the use of dwm's window tiling manager to allow efficient, continuous and conjunctive writing of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and {\TeX}\ documents alongside browser testing (Brave Browser). Any supporting non-essential documentation such as notes are written in plain text (\texttt{.txt}) files using Vim and comma-separated (\texttt{.csv}) files using SC-IM. [All. Plain. Text.]

		\subsubsection{User Interface}

	HTML (HTML5) is used to create the base functionality of this system as it supports all necessary APIs and external scripts. HTML also allows integration of appropriate external stylesheets such as those used to support access to FontAwesome. A minor non-noted script is used to allow the use of {\TeX}\ syntax when writing supporting content such as formul\ae. Furthermore, the benefits of using CSS (CSS3) include: design, scalability and accessibility factors and have been previously discussed. A CSS-less site may be more functional and relatable however, good CSS takes a system from a plain website to a relevant web application. Furthermore, JavaScript ties-in the interactivity and manipulation of the APIs. A combination of external and local scripts are used to [1] make the APIs functional, and [2] make them relevant, respectively. Additionally, there are smaller JavaScript elements throughout the system which do not relate to pure functionality and serve purposes such as the manipulation of CSS and styling elements, etc. Serif Page Plus X9 and GIMP are used in Windows 7 and Artix Linux respectively for graphic design and photo manipulation purposes as previously discussed.

		\subsubsection{Supporting Data}

	JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files are included to store relevant data as previously discussed, and detailed in Figure A4. They interact with elements of JavaScript scripts to allow access to, fetching of, and use of relevant data for computations and output on the site. If the site were to be expanded in the future to contain user data and a log-in system for example, supporting data would extend to a collection of CSV (\texttt{.csv}) files, and various PHP (\texttt{.php}) and SQL (\texttt{.sql}) protocol. These would be used to write, store, organize/manage and access (read) larger-scale data and requests.

	\subsection{Application Programming Interfaces \& Libraries}

	Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and JavaScript libraries are included in the development process of this system in order to use and build upon unique layers of existing web material and interface with them using various, in some cases, [free and open-source] JavaScript libraries. Libraries of course being additional pre-defined functions and methods etc., which can be used with the addition of various scripts and stylesheets in order to enable and initialize use of APIs.

		\subsubsection{Geolocation}

	The Geolocation API (Geolocation, 2022) is used to access the current latitude and longitude of the user's device. This has many applications, as detailed in Table 6.3 and Figure A6, such as displaying the user's current coordinates as a string, calculating distances, fetching weather data for the user's current location, displaying the user's current coordinates on a map, etc.

		\subsubsection{Open Weather}

	The OpenWeather API (OpenWeather, 2022) is used to provide access to a comprehensive collection of weather statistics in a JSON format. It includes minutely, hourly and daily data; of which, hourly and daily are used in querying and presentation in the `Weather' section (weather app).

		\subsubsection{Ordnance Survey (OS)}

		The Ordnance Survey (Ordnance Survey, 2022) API is a topographical map API, used in conjunction with Leaflet (section 6.3.4), to display and produce base map layers in a website. Used in this context are \textit{Leisure} maps: OS Road (1 : 250 000), OS Landranger (1 : 50 000) and OS Explorer (1 : 25 000); \textit{Road} maps 1 : 50 000 and 1 : 25 000; and \textit{Outdoor} maps 1 : 50 000 and 1 : 25 000. Note that this API did require some adjustment upon initiation. As this system is primarily based on the Leisure map, it uses the EPSG:27700 coordinate system. Therefore, the origin point of the map layer required manual calibration in order to function with the iconic 1984 EPSG:4326 system; to which all associated GPX, GeoJSON and JSON relate.
		
		\subsubsection{Leaflet}

		Leaflet (Leaflet, 2022) is a JavaScript library used to produce and manipulate map layers from a map API. It's used in this context for the majority of the functionality under the `Conquest Map', as discussed in various sections and appendices throughout this report.

		\subsubsection{Mapbox GL-JS}

		A Mapbox GL-JS (Mapbox, 2022) script was used in this site for the conversion of GPX files to GeoJSON when being read in JavaScript scripts. This is an essential component at the stage where route GPX files are read and thus [1] printed as a Leaflet line on the map, and [2] used to determine the start coordinates of a route in order to produce a Leaflet marker for that location.

		\subsubsection{Chart.js}
	
		Chart.js (Chart.js, 2022) is a JavaScript library for graphing statistics. It was originally intended for use in the `Ranger' section of the site, which would have acted as another page equivalent to the `Conquest Map' based on user-input-based data analysis. Some of it's features would also be available to view and used to manipulate route searching in `Conquest Map', much like `Ability' and `Equipment'.\\

		The separate graphing page, or `calculator', would have included features based on elevation profile, speed input, power input, heart rate input, etc., which could be analysed through the graphing and charting of protocol such as the following:

		\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
			\item Select: constant speed (max); Output: required time and power
			\item Select: constant speed (average); Output: required time and power
			\item Select: constant power Output; Output: required speed and time
			\item Input: target speed; Output: Required time and power
			\item Input: target power output; Output: required time and power
			\item Input: target energy output; Output: required time and power
		\end{itemize}

		As previously noted, this portion was omitted due to time constraints and lack of relevance to the brief. Although it could make a future appearance beyond the constraints of this project.

	\subsection{Project Management}

	The primary goal in constructing this site remains to be the delivery of a functional web application, relative to the brief and requirements, by the project deadline in August. To ensure that the appropriate time and resources are allocated to each segment of the system's construction, continuous planning and documentation was applied. Not extensively or in any professional manner however, as this is still a [solo project]. This process does ensure a clear understanding of resource/environment management, system layers, and the scale and scope of elements.

		\subsubsection{Life-Cycle}

	No formal framework is used in this scenario. However, the project is divided into intuitive sections which segment: project planning; gathering of supporting data; user interface functionality and data use; and, continuous testing and documentation. With reference to the testing stages, each element developed is tested as soon as is necessary by the developer (myself), to instantly correct minor issues. In the latter stages, the system is tested as-a-whole by myself and externals, and analysed in more depth. This style of testing does indeed have some relevance to the `sprint' concept of `Agile' in that project stages are assigned periods which involve continuous reference to the user-centered approach of requirements and testing. Each stage of this also considers the discussed MoSCoW hierarchy.\\

	Throughout this project I adhere to a very minimal and efficient schedule kept using my [Calcurse] calendar client. An overview of this schedule can be seen in the below GANTT Chart, in Table 6.5. It illustrates all of the major project aspects listed above. Note that a chart such as this is always subject to amendment. This illustrative method is useful for both milestones and available tolerances. The chart runs from the dedicated project timespan: the first full week in May (w/c 2$^\textrm{nd}$) until the final full week in July (w/e 31$^\textrm{st}$) (13 weeks). Secondly, I maintain a plain text notes file which allows me to clearly list `to-do' items, issues, constraints, test results, and things alike; for review, amendment and write-up at a later date.

		\subsubsection{Supporting Tools}

	Following from section 6.2 and it's Table 6.4, the `transcription' section remains not-discussed. For this purpose, a more [neomodernist] installment of [Donald E. Knuth's {\TeX}] ({\LaTeX}) is used to compose and transcribe formal final report material. Again, plain text (\texttt{.tex}) files are the option favoured as it's most efficient and easiest to work with. These are compiled using (PDF){\LaTeX}\ in this case, into versatile PDF (\texttt{.pdf}) documents. Although some mathematical and \texttt{tikz} elements could benefit from the use of (\textsc{Xe}){\LaTeX}. My [neoMutt] e-mail client is used in the distribution of surveys etc. to testers and people alike.\\

	Finally, \href{https://github.com/FedeRog1977}{GitHub} is favoured as the version control manager for this site and it's documentation. This provides `assurance' of the safety of documents and insurance in the case of local issues. For example, in a scenario requiring Git Revert or simply restoring a backup. As this is a web application, the directory tree is equivalent to the system tree of the site. In the future, this site could also be deployed using GitHub pages, much like \href{http://lewisbritton.com/}{lewisbritton.com}. If code from this site, such as the region and landmass data JSON file, were to be published on a more professional basis, a Markdown (\texttt{.md}) README file would be composed and added to my GitHub.

	\subsection{Design \& Construction Review}

	In summary, the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript worked as efficiently as expected. The system was created on-schedule, implemented all of the necessary requirements and effectively made use of the required APIs and Libraries. No major construction issues were encountered; only minor design ones, as discussed, which are near-irrelevant and manageable. The command line always makes for an effective environment to [compose and perform], and test, all relevant material. There are no alternatives or other methodologies, environments or frameworks worth considering from my perspective here.

		\subsubsection{Prototyping -- Pages}

	With reference to the GANTT chart in Table 6.5, this portion refers to the continuous prototyping and review completed by the developer (myself), throughout development.\\

	The format of page prototyping follows the process used to iterate through functionality testing; using HTML elements and the `console'. This is much like the demonstration process seen in the video demo as part of this submission.

		\subsubsection{Prototyping -- Scalability}

	The format of mobile prototyping follows the process used to iterate through functionality testing; using HTML elements and the `console' relative to the mobile-scaled site version. This is much like the demonstration process seen in the video demo as part of this submission.

	\subsection{Testing}

	Being the command line interfacer I am, if you write a shell script which doesn't work, you know about it; it doesn't \textit{function}. You keep perfecting it until it does what you want it to do. Similarly with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you must use the output of the site to determine what works and what doesn't.

		\subsubsection{`Test-Driven' Development}

	Driving the `continuous testing' element of this system is the above concept; where components are constantly tested every few lines of code (or relevant interval) for their function in-browser and in command line (`console'). It's this process which makes plain-text developed sites the perfect environment to learn in, develop, and produce exactly what you want. In-browser HTML testing adheres to a similar protocol to that of compiling a {\TeX}\ document; you constantly add small elements, save and refresh to check the code's integrity. This method allows you to test extremely small increments, isolated from code in other locations, given the appropriate directory tree and file formatting.\\

	This concept applies to all HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For example, you may call JavaScript functions in specific locations, using very basic HTML, to test them isolated from any additional functionality. This has a minimal effect on the aggregate system. This process also ensures that there's little-to-no `technical debt' accumulation, resulting in a backlog of errors and delay of the development cycle.\\

			\paragraph{Heuristic Evaluations}

	With reference to the GANTT chart in Table 6.5, this portion refers to the continuous isolated element testing completed by [1] the developer (myself) and [2] externals, throughout development. The developer testing has been described. In the case of externals, the discussed small group of development students and professionals (simulated clients) were simply asked to repeat small inputs and processes alike at intervals, just as practiced by myself. The `externals' portion of this is presented in the `heuristic evaluations' seen in Figure A7, and generated many ideas for the, latterly discussed, isolated and comprehensive testing methods seen in Figure A8. Often, this approach generates new requirements as development goes on and potential users realise they want more. This was not the case here. See Table 2.1 for a reminded of heuristic factors and severity ratings. Despite the comprehensiveness of this approach, it did not generate many issues, likely due to the minimalistic and efficient interface design, and initial understanding of requirements.

		\subsubsection{User Acceptance (UAT), Accessibility \& Usability}

	User Acceptance Testing essentially describes the satisfaction of conditions which must be met in order to accept or reject fulfillment of [1] the requirements, and [2] additional accessibility and other aesthetic features. Surveying, of student and professional developers and myself, is the selected method of data collection. Reviewing critique upon intervals and comprehensively, with the appropriate sample size, provides accurate and relevant quantitative and qualitative results and highlights consistency of the usability and `flow' of the final aggregate system. Reference to the recursion tree (section 5.2.2) also aids testers here. In larger-scale developments, this would likely be outsourced.\\

	With reference to the GANTT chart in Table 6.5, this portion refers to the isolated and comprehensive element testing completed by [1] externals and [2] the developer (myself), post-completion. Alike the former, developer testing has been described, external testing is issued in the same manner. Decisions were made on a tangibility-basis. This process was documented as described under the following headings. Note that, with reference to the discussed Figure A8, some \texttt{function}s do not appear as they do in Figure A6 and vice-versa. This is because Figure A6 details all `functional' functions which are used by the system, where Figure A8 details all functions which a user interacts with.

			\paragraph{Isolated Testing}

	The document issued and completed to and by externals and myself relating to isolated element testing, with aggregated results, appears under Figure A8. Externals were asked to test features solely. Feedback is delivered and acted upon at the relevant intervals throughout development; averaging every two-to-three weeks.

			\paragraph{Comprehensive Testing}

	The document issued and completed to and by externals and myself relating to comprehensive element testing, with aggregated results, appears under Figure A8. Externals were asked to test features on a full-system run-through to account for fatigue (therefore, ease of use). Feedback is delivered and acted upon near the end of the development process. This component is often referred to as `system testing' and involves a large team of testers from the development team and dedicated externals. It's usually purely requirements-based.

		\subsubsection{Unit Testing \& Suites}

	Unit testing and testing `suites' refer to various tools which exist which claim to `text the integrity' of JavaScript and JavaScript-based elements using their relevant HTML counterparts and interfaces or solely the document.

			\paragraph{HTML, CSS \& JavaScript Benchmarking}

 	Popular tools such as Unit.js and Mocha appear within frameworks such as Node.js and in browsers such as Chromium. This system is of course anti-bloatware and anti-spyware and thus, avoids `big-tech' proprietary software. These tools are designed to allow developers to write `test cases' which simulate an interface instance with the HTML and JavaScript elements. In this case, a three-thousand-line table of results with stats to five significant figures is of no benefit. On a larger-scale project with scalability, this would be relevant. Human interaction with elements on this scale leads to faster problem solving. On a separate note, all JavaScript functions are tested, given test inputs where appropriate, not only as part of their HTML elements but also in the `console' in-browser to ensure they function solely. This is not documented as results are subjective and no issues occurred.\\

	I gave in to the \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL9fnVtz_lc}{Heat} and installed the command line tool \texttt{npm node} which allows you to interface with features of the Node.js API such as script validators. \texttt{amphtml-validator} was used to validate the integrity of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. No major issues occured when running this protocol. Any issues indicated were either related to justified syntax `disagreements' and various unrecognised Leaflet syntax. There is likely a way of amending the package to account for Leaflet however, it was irrelevant as all issues were readable and the tool will not be used in the future.

			\paragraph{JSON Benchmarking}

	As the majority of the functionality of the JavaScript in this sits is based on the integrity and content of the associated JSON-data-store files, it's essential that these documents are completely integral to see that functions deliver content as intended.\\

	The most [crucial component] is validity testing as the file is simply not accessible is errors are present. For this purpose, the Python library \texttt{JSON-Spec}, implemented by the command line tool \texttt{json}, is used. It validates JSON files in a manner much like that in the definition of logic and relationships in databases; the format of the input JSON file is compared to a `JSON schema' which defines the desired structure and syntax. For example in this project, \texttt{Hills.json} is compared to \texttt{schema.json}. As the JSON files used for this system range between the mid-thousands (of lines), this method is [infitinely more valuable] than manual iteration. Additionally, to ensure the schema document itself is valid, the java-command-line tool \texttt{json-schema-validator} is used.\\

	The \textit{Elastic Stack} (Elastic, 2022) was also used in testing the capabilities of \texttt{Hills.json}. The \texttt{elastic search} and \texttt{kibana} command line tools were used in a developer-testing session to query various aspects of the file and make simulations based on data attributes. All parent and major child attributes were exhausted in testing, subject to what was appropriate.\\

	\subsection{Restrictions}

	Some alterations and omissions were made based upon the given constraints of the project. For detailed descriptions and justifications of these, revise the list under section 4.1.3, in \textit{Data Gathering} and various locations throughout the \textit{System Design} and \texttt{System Construction} sections. None of these directly impact the requirements of the system; all requirements are still delivered. This note excludes the `Ranger' portion of the site as the decision was made early to omit all of its features as they were non-essential.

	\subsection{Enhancements}

		\subsubsection{Design}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item Most importantly, given more time, the `Ranger' graphing system would have been a major part of this site; allowing users the freedom to analyse statistics in far more detail. However due to the constraints; the fact these features aren't relevant to the brief; and more-detailed focus on the integrity of individual elements of the existing system, it's structure and write-up; the system remains without.\\
		\item On a wider scope, the cycling equivalent of all the hiking features, and more, should be added to the site to make it more comprehensive and inclusive
		\item When showing a route on `Conquest Map', currently all hills covered on that route are shown. Functionality which allows the user to specify/refine which kind of hills (Munros, Munro Tops, etc.) they would like to see on that route would be useful.
		\item As discussed under section 5.2.3.2, additional graphic design would have been favoured in places such as the `Conquest Map' and on the home page, simply as aesthetic pieces, if it weren't for the time constraint and lack of relevance.
		\item For symmetry and continuity leading form the `Drafting' portion to the `Conquest Map', weather elements should be implemented with different effect on route outputs, just like those relating to ability and equipments
		\item Improve the overall functionality relating to re-starting the process of refining routes; involving a better hierarchy of clearing and re-ordering restrictions
		\item Complete the cloud types suggested reading under `Weather' to provide a better understanding of how clouds and their precipitation can effect routes
		\item Complete the comprehensive collection of photos relating to ability and equipment components, for display on request under `Conditioning'
	\end{itemize}
	
		\subsubsection{Construction}

	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item Some variable and function names which were created during different time periods in the project could use revision as they are slightly inconsistent in places. For example, input functions which serve the same purpose (searching the JSON file for a Munro name) in the weather app and `Overview'/`Conquest Map' sections have inconsistent syntax in their names: \texttt{inpMunroOpt()} and \texttt{searchLocation()}, respectively. Although one of these does just search Munros and the other, all hills; naming convention should still be consistent, for example: \texttt{searchMunro()} and \texttt{searchLocation()}, respectively. Minor consistency/continuity issues like this should be fixed given greater time allocated to non-functional code readability issues.
		\item Just as the function \texttt{showNearest()} takes an input parameter to determine what kind of hill is being examined (Munro, Munro Top, Corbett, Corbett Top), so too should the two sets of functions: \texttt{showMunros()}, \texttt{showMunroTops()}, \texttt{showCorbe- tts()}, \texttt{showCorbettTops()}; \texttt{showMunro()}, \texttt{showMunroTop()}, \texttt{showCorbett()}, \texttt{sh- owCorbettTop()}; respectively, as they simply repeat logic which iterates through different attributes. This is due to developer skill development throughout development and is justified due to the nature of this university course and time constraints.
		\item I don't even know what happened but the majority of the tables' double \verb|\hline|'s got messed up in compilation, in this document. They just appear as a thick line. Probably something to do with all the bloated packages I've used. This seems minor but it bothers me more then any of the other issues.
	\end{itemize}

\newpage

	\subsection{Development Conclusions}

	Most logical conclusions can be deduced from the former portions of this section. The system design, construction and development was successful. It met the crucial client requirements and there weren't any major issues involved. All stages of testing and associated communication operated smoothly and led to successful further requirement and software development. The `client's' needs are satisfied with the final product. Any restrictions are fairly minor when observing the brief. The only major note is that the system is not as efficient as possible due to some inconsistencies caused by the aforementioned ongoing skill development in the developer (myself).

			\textbf{Feature Separation}: The OS Maps displaying Munros and Corbetts etc. are displayed on different pages of the site, with navigation links between them. This means that interaction with features is limited to the point where all a user can do is view the information provided about it upon a click and follow further links from there. They cannot for example, toggle on/off different features while interacting with the map meaning isolating different features on a GPS route a user is viewing is impossible. & $\mathrm{H_{3}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{3}}$ & Implement a toggle feature for access to different map feature when the user desires, as listed in requirements\\

			\textbf{Weather Misuse}:\newline Weather data is only available as part of complete routes. I.e. activities which are complete and have been saved. Strava use a weather API so it is hard to understand why they would bot integrate this as a basic summary feature on the home page or on a profile etc. Historic weather data, i.e. that printed on complete routes, is the most irrelevant use of such as, come on, the user already knows what the weather was like on their routes and if they want to show off a 20hr hike in a snow storm or something, upload a picture & $\mathrm{H_{3}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{3}}$ & Include a comprehensive weather system, as listed in requirements\\

		\multicolumn{4}{c}{\textsc{Map Features}}\\
		\hline
			\textbf{Map Layers}:\newline Although the Mapbox map seen throughout Strava is used very effectively in hosting many dynamic layers such as customizable GPX routes with terrain' and athlete-specific attributes, it is just a basic map with contours, not a full topographical map. This significantly limits interaction with map features and interpretation as it simply doesn't show many of the relevant aspects to hiking & $\mathrm{H_{2}}$, $\mathrm{H_{3}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{3}}$ & Utilize the OS Map API instead of a more basic one to ensure full access to topographical mapping, as listed in requirements\\

                \scriptsize
        \begin{longtable}{p{7.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{4cm}}
                \textsc{Description} & \textsc{Vio.} & \textsc{Sev.} & \textsc{Proposed Solution}\\
                \hline
		\hline
		\multicolumn{4}{c}{\textsc{Functionality}}\\
		\hline
		\hline
		\multicolumn{4}{c}{\textsc{Page Select -- `Drafting Room' and `Conquest Map'}}\\
		\hline
		\textbf{Pages Drop Element}:\newline Seems unnecessary to use a drop-down element to display only one working page (`Conquest Map') under `Field' when the other (`Ranger') is simply a string of text with no link. & $\mathrm{H_{3}}$, $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Remove drop-down element and replace drop-down link `Field' with a simple page link to the `Conquest Map', named `Conquest'; like `Drafting'\\
		\textbf{Summary Section}:\newline The `Quick Burn' summary section on the home page has very little purpose and serves minimal beneficial function to users as it only returns two sets of semi-contextualized text. It seems out of place and unfitting with the subsequent quality of elements & $\mathrm{H_{2}}$, $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Remove HTML elements and all associated functions. Functions appear later in more `functional' contexts later anyway\\
		\textbf{Weather Result Title}:\newline Two functions exist when requesting weather results from the `Weather' section: one which feeds the relevant coordinates values into the `Latitude' and `Longitude' input boxes, and one which requests weather results form the API using those values. It can be confusing when the user either selects a location for the first time or selects another location while results for one are already displayed, and the results don't appear/change due to the requirement to trigger the second function with a button & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Add ellipsis (...) suffix to the title displayed upon function executed by the selection of a location and remove the suffix upon function executed when the button is selected to fetch results. Therefore, implying ``waiting for interaction'', ``not waiting for interaction''\\
		\textbf{Map Layer Select}:\newline Map layer select options were originally contained within the pop-out options menu. This was not optimally intuitive as users would often overlook it when browsing more advanced functions. For those who did use it, the portion of the viewable map remaining with the menu expanded was not ideal for sampling and choosing different map layers when cycling through them & $\mathrm{H_{3}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Give the map layer options their own element on the equivalent level of the options menu toggle. Thus seeing that everything in the options menu layers upon the map, and everything outwith the options menu changes the map itself. It also opens the entire map space for sampling layers\\
		\textbf{Show Corbett Tops}:\newline Show Munros, Show Munro Tops, Show Corbetts and Show Corbett Tops all operate fine upon initial inspection however, if Show Corbett Tops is toggled then a route is shown, the Leaflet line displaying the GPX coordinates does not scale to map zoom. I.e. it remains the same relative size to the initial level of zoom. If just the latter three `show' options have been toggled, this issue does not occur. & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{5}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Many-an-hour have been exerted on this issue but I'm afraid I give up. I'm not spending any more time on it. I am [Pink Wojak] (Figure B6).\\
		\textbf{Show Nearest Munro/Corbett}:\newline Both of these buttons (using the same function) work fine when used in isolation however, when using the function to show the nearest Munro after using it to show the nearest Corbett, no values are returned. Contrastingly, when using the function to show the nearest Corbett after using it to show the nearest Munro, there are no issues. & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{5}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Many-an-hour have been exerted on this issue but I'm afraid I give up. I'm not spending any more time on it. I am [Pink Wojak] (Figure B6).\\
		\textbf{Search Route}:\newline Displaying a summary and the route (on map) of a route all at once feels slightly ``cluttered'' as an HTML element is being filled with a significant amount of text while the center of the map is finding the start of a route and printing multiple pieces on it. These two functions also produce their results at different speeds, adding a slightly ``cheap'' delayed feel to the process & $\mathrm{H_{3}}$, $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Separate the functions into two of their own features which are executed through two separate options. That is, a user can view a summary of a route before deciding if they wish to print it, with its attributes, on the map\\
		\textbf{Route Display Error}:\newline When displaying some routes on the `Conquest Map', the part of the function used to return the start coordinates, and thus place a Leaflet marker and center the map to there, returns a value which cannot be translated using the coordinate conversion algorithm. Therefore, when these routes are selected the map is centered somewhere completely irrelevant; in the middle of the ocean & $\mathrm{H_{5}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{3}}$ & Unfortunately, no immediate solution as this is an issue based on the structure of particular GPX files. This occurs purely with GPX files downloaded from Walkhighlands' official source; not with walk report (user donated) GPX files or with my own. Given more time, non-official-Walkhighlands replacements for these files would be found, however, the functionality is still clearly there and can be executed upon all other GPX files\\

		\textbf{Header Contrast}:\newline There isn't enough contrast between the black logo and the header background color however, there is almost too much contrast between the navigation font color and the header background color & $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Experiment with gradients to balance the contrast. This will also add a themes of speed and urgency, and harmonise with the directional transition of the logo upon page load\\
		\textbf{Background Image}:\newline The background image arguably contains [1] too many cold colors and [2] too much variation in geometry and layers, meaning it's complexity takes-away from the content intended to primarily be used by the user & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$ $\mathrm{H_{7}}$, $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Replace image with one which integrates more appropriate warm colors which are relevant to the context and consistent geometry and layers which make content easily viewable\\
		\textbf{Logo Drop Shadow}:\newline With the new warm-colored, basic-layered background image, the black and red logo becomes slightly less easily visible & $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Add a deeper drop shadow to the logo to add contrast between it and the background image\\
		\textbf{Button Hover Color-Transparency Ratio}:\newline The `Begin Conquest' button on the intro section always has an opacity value which is less then 1. When `hovered' upon, the background of the button fills with a transparent white to match the border. The opacity value is too low to make the text easily visible on the white background & $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Either [1] Increase the opacity value of the button's colors, or [2] change the white hover background color to something which doesn't lose as much dominance when made slightly transparent. Option 2 executed\\
		\textbf{Intro Text}:\newline The large body of introductory text on the intro background image appears in a fully opaque white. Due to the length of the text, the repetitive white text take the form of white lines which take-away from the other elements in the section & $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Experiment with opacity values of the text color to find the correct balance of readability and harmony with the background\\
		\textbf{`Briefing' Titles and Symbols}:\newline The three selectable headings in the `Briefing' section were originally presented just using their associated FontAwesome symbols to attempt to keep this process minimal. However, although the symbols are relevant, they only become clearly so after viewing each section and therefore, remove form the efficiency they were intended to create & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$, $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Add relevant heading text to indicate sections\\
		\textbf{Options Menu}:\newline The options menu for the `Conquest Map' requires a significant amount of space due to its capabilities therefore, making a large portion of the map not-viewable when it's expanded. This cannot be directly altered however may require some additional design feature to make the menu blend-in a bit more naturally & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Add slight transparency to the background of the options menu to make other portions of the page and map viewable while it's expanded, and add a layer of depth as opposed to being faced with a box of white space over a pretty map\\
		\textbf{`Seeking' Bar}:\newline The seeking bar displaying two empty value fields adds a ``cheap'' feel to the map before the user pans to display the panning coordinates & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Hide the `Seeking' bar until the user has begun panning the map\\

		\subsubsection*{Figure B1: Linguistics of `{\LaTeX}'}

	{\LaTeX} (or LaTeX, even latex (Donald E. Knuth's more recent installment of {\TeX})) is usually pronounced /la\textlengthmark t$\varepsilon$k/ (`lah') or /le\textsc{i}t$\varepsilon$k/ (`lei'/`lay') in English (that is, not with the /ks/ pronunciation English speakers normally associate with X, but with a /k/). The characters T, E, X in the name come from capital Greek letters tau, epsilon, and chi, as the name of {\TeX} derives from the Greek: $\tau\varepsilon\chi\nu\eta$ (skill, art, technique, precision); for this reason, Donald E. Knuth promotes a pronunciation of /t$\varepsilon$k/ (tekh) (that is, with a voiceless velar fricative as in Modern Greek, similar to the last sound of the German word ``Bach", the Spanish ``j" sound, or as ``ch'' in a Scottish `loch').

		\subsubsection*{Figure B3: Linguistics of `Burning Roots'}

	The service is called `\textit{Burning Roots}'. No, the rhetorical use of satiric misspelling is not unintentional malapropism; it is in fact deliberate. In harmony with the feeling you'd experience when [racing south-west to Lone Stallion Ranch], the term references that certain `\textit{burning} desire' for freedom in the sweet country air, the one you only experience when digging to your deepest `\textit{roots}' to achieve a new personal record or firmly assert your dominance over your inferiors. This service uses and computes data to encourage a user to take to the trails with motivation to be the fastest, most efficient, most prepared and most endured athlete on their \textit{routes}.

		\subsubsection*{Figure B4: Lorn and Lorne}

		Many of the uneducated among us (hahaha) often confuse the term `Lorn' with `Lorne'. Although it's argued by many inbred highlanders that the two words may be used interchangeably, our slavemasters at Ordnance Survey have determined otherwise; that `Lorn' refers to the division found in the OS region \textit{Fort William, Lochaber and Lorn} (as printed in OS Explorer 384: Glen Coe \& Glen Etive); where, `Lorne' refers to the popular breakfast food choice of alcoholics, drug addicts, and fine gentlemen named Derek.\\

		Henceforth, when in the region of Fort William, Lochaber and Lorn, myself and my gentlemen often like to retire after a long night at [BAR] to [Lee's kitchen] where we will cook up a storm of Lorne. Over many hours of experimentation and trials, we have produced the following rankings:

			4 & Simon Howie (Beef) & \textasciitilde35\% & Slightly underwhelming and rubbery version of the steak pieces, with a less meaty flavour, bordering on the fatty side. & \vspace{-0.25cm}\includegraphics[width=2.5cm]{../System/Photos/sh_lorne2.png}\\

		\subsubsection*{Figure B5: Score Route -- Mathematical Notation}

	\textbf{[1.1] Conversion Constants:}

	$$c_{ft}=0.3048$$
	$$c_{mi}=1.609$$

	Where:\\
	$c_{ft}=$ Conversion constant for imperial feet to metric meters\\
	$c_{mi}=$ Conversion constant for imperial miles to metric kilometers ($\times10^{3}$m)\\

	\textbf{[1.2] Number of Tops:}

	$$N_{\mathrm{Tops}}=\sum^{I}_{i=1}N_{i}+\sum^{J}_{j=1}N_{j}+\sum^{K}_{k=1}N_{k}+\sum^{L}_{l=1}N_{l}$$
	$$\lor\ N_{\mathrm{Tops}}=\vert i\vert + \vert j\vert + \vert k\vert + \vert l\vert$$

	Where:\\
	$N_{\mathrm{Tops}}=$ Total number of tops present on given route\\
	$N_{i,j,k,l}=$ Numerical value representing the position of a string element $i,j,k,l$ in arrays of $i$: route type, $j$: route stages, $k$: terrain types, $l$: terrain difficulties; $i\in\{1,...I\}$, $j\in\{1,...J\}$, $k\in\{1,...K\}$, $l\in\{1,...L\}$\\

	\textbf{[1.3] Elevation:}

	$$\mathrm{Elev}_{m}=c_{ft}\mathrm{Elev}_{ft}$$

	Where:\\
	$\mathrm{Elev}_{m}=$ Total elevation gained on given route, in meters (m)\\
	$\mathrm{Elev}_{ft}=$ Total elevation gained on given route, in feet (ft)\\

	\textbf{[1.4] Distance:}

	$$\mathrm{Dist}_{km}=c_{mi}\mathrm{Dist}_{mi}$$

	Where:\\
	$\mathrm{Dist}_{km}=$ Total distance covered on given route, in kilometers (km)\\
	$\mathrm{Dist}_{mi}=$ Total distance covered on given route, in miles (mi)\\

	\textbf{[2.1] Weights:}\\

	For Route Type's, Route Stages', Terrain Types', Terrain Difficulties' Elements\\

	This method defines equally weighted elements by dividing 1 by the number of elements in the arrays. Where $i,j,k,l$ refer to arrays and positions within their respective arrays:

	$$w_{i}=\frac{1}{\sum^{I}_{i=1}N_{i}},\ w_{j}=\frac{1}{\sum^{J}_{j=1}N_{j}},\ w_{k}=\frac{1}{\sum^{K}_{k=1}N_{k}},\ w_{l}=\frac{1}{\sum^{L}_{l=1}N_{l}}$$
	$$\lor\ w_{i}=\frac{1}{\vert i\vert},\ w_{j}=\frac{1}{\vert j\vert},\ w_{k}=\frac{1}{\vert k\vert},\ w_{l}=\frac{1}{\vert l\vert}$$

	$$\therefore w_{i}, w_{j}, w_{k}, w_{l}\ \textrm{always constant and equally weighted}$$

	Where:\\
	$w_{i,j,k,l}=$ Equally weighted value based on number of elements for element $i,j,k,l$ in arrays of $i$: route type, $j$: route stages, $k$: terrain types, $l$: terrain difficulties; $i\in\{1,...I\}$, $j\in\{1,...J\}$, $k\in\{1,...K\}$, $l\in\{1,...L\}$\\
	$N_{i,j,k,l}=$ Numerical value representing the position of a string element $i,j,k,l$ in arrays of $i$: route type, $j$: route stages, $k$: terrain types, $l$: terrain difficulties; $i\in\{1,...I\}$, $j\in\{1,...J\}$, $k\in\{1,...K\}$, $l\in\{1,...L\}$\\

	\textbf{[2.2] Scores:}\\

	For Route Type, Route Stages, Terrain Types, Terrain Difficulties

	$$S_{i}=\sum^{I}_{i=1} w_{i}V_{i},\ S_{j}=\sum^{J}_{j=1} w_{j}V_{j},\ S_{k}=\sum^{K}_{k=1} w_{k}V_{k},\ S_{l}=\sum^{L}_{l=1} w_{l}V_{l},$$

	Where:\\
	$S_{i,j,k,l}=$ Relative score of element $i,j,k,l$ in arrays of $i$: route type, $j$: route stages, $k$: terrain types, $l$: terrain difficulties; $i\in\{1,...I\}$, $j\in\{1,...J\}$, $k\in\{1,...K\}$, $l\in\{1,...L\}$\\
	$V_{i,j,k,l}=$ Subjectively defined value assigned to element $i,j,k,l$ in arrays of $i$: route type, $j$: route stages, $k$: terrain types, $l$: terrain difficulties; $i\in\{1,...I\}$, $j\in\{1,...J\}$, $k\in\{1,...K\}$, $l\in\{1,...L\}$\\

\newpage

	An example for the route type array ($i$) which contains three equally weighted elements follows:

	$$S_{i}=w_{1}V_{1}+w_{2}V_{2}+w_{3}V_{3}$$
	$$S_{i}=\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)+\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)+\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$$
	$$S_{i}=\frac{1}{3}=0.\textrm{\.{3}}$$
	
	As these values are generated from an array, they involve single-column (no inversion) matrix algebra in the context of JavaScript. An example of the appropriate notation relating to the previous example follows (decimal values favoured in matrices):

	$$S_{i}=\left[0.\textrm{\.{3}}\ 0.\textrm{\.{3}}\ 0.\textrm{\.{3}}\right]\left[0.25\ 0.25\ 0.5\right]$$
	$$S_{i}=0.\textrm{\.{3}}$$

	Again, as this is single-column matrix algebra, standard notation is also viable:

	$$S_{i}=\begin{bmatrix}w_{1}\\w_{2}\\w_{3}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{1}\\V_{2}\\V_{3}\end{bmatrix}$$
	$$S_{i}=\begin{bmatrix}0.\textrm{\.{3}}\\0.\textrm{\.{3}}\\0.\textrm{\.{3}}\\\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0.25\\0.25\\0.5\end{bmatrix}$$
	$$S_{i}=0.\textrm{\.{3}}$$

	For each of the route element factor arrays, these are then aggregated to give a total value. However, they still do not have any context which is why a multiplier is used.\\

	\textbf{[2.3] Weights:}\\

	For Route Type, Route Stages, Terrain Types, Terrain Difficulties

	$$w_{S_{i}},\ w_{S_{j}},\ w_{S_{k}},\ w_{S_{l}}$$

	Do not confuse these with the equal weightings for each individual element within the arrays, these four weightings exist on a subjective basis to weight the four scores for each array.\\

	Where:\\
	$w_{S_{i,j,k,l}}=$ Weight values determining the importance of arrays of $i$: route type, $j$: route stages, $k$: terrain types, $l$: terrain difficulties; $i\in\{1,...I\}$, $j\in\{1,...J\}$, $k\in\{1,...K\}$, $l\in\{1,...L\}$\\

	\textbf{[3.1] Complete Multiplier:}

	$$m_{R}=\frac{N_{\mathrm{Tops}}}{\left(\frac{\mathrm{Elev_{m}}}{1000\left(\mathrm{Dist_{km}}\right)}\right)}$$
	$$\textbf{Expanded: }m_{R}=\frac{\sum^{I}_{i=1}N_{i}+\sum^{J}_{j=1}N_{j}+\sum^{K}_{k=1}N_{k}+\sum^{L}_{l=1}N_{l}}{\left(\frac{c_{ft}\mathrm{Elev_{ft}}}{1000\left(c_{mi}\mathrm{Dist_{mi}}\right)}\right)}$$

	Where:\\
	$m_{R}=$ Multiplier for given route $R$\\

	In English, this equation reads: ``number of tops (Munro, Munro Top, Corbett, Corbett Top) achieved on the route per vertical meter gained on the route, per horizontal meter gained on the route''.\\

	\textbf{[3.2] Complete Aggregate Route Score:}

	$$S_{R}=w_{S_{i}}S_{i}+w_{S_{j}}S_{j}+w_{S_{k}}S_{k}+w_{S_{l}}S_{l}$$
	$$\textbf{Expanded (1): }S_{R}=w_{S_{i}}\left(\sum^{I}_{i=1} w_{i}V_{i}\right)+...+w_{S_{l}}\left(\sum^{L}_{l=1} w_{l}V_{l}\right)$$
	$$\textbf{Expanded (2): }S_{R}=w_{S_{i}}\left(\sum^{I}_{i=1} \left(\frac{1}{\sum^{I}_{i=1}N_{i}}\right)V_{i}\right)+...+w_{S_{l}}\left(\sum^{L}_{l=1} \left(\frac{1}{\sum^{L}_{l=1}N_{l}}\right)V_{l}\right)$$

	Where:\\
	$S_{R}=$ Aggregate route score for given route $R$\\

	\textbf{[4] Complete Adjusted Route Score:}

	$$S_{R(A)}=m_{R}\left(w_{S_{i}}S_{i}+w_{S_{j}}S_{j}+w_{S_{k}}S_{k}+w_{S_{l}}S_{l}\right)$$

	$$\textbf{Expanded (1):}$$
	$$S_{R(A)}=\left(\frac{N_{\mathrm{Tops}}}{\left(\frac{\mathrm{Elev_{m}}}{1000\left(\mathrm{Dist_{km}}\right)}\right)}\right)\left(w_{S_{i}}\left(\sum^{I}_{i=1} w_{i}V_{i}\right)+...+w_{S_{l}}\left(\sum^{L}_{l=1} w_{l}V_{l}\right)\right)$$
	$$\textbf{Expanded (2):}$$
	$$S_{R(A)}=\left(\frac{\sum^{I}_{i=1}N_{i}+\sum^{J}_{j=1}N_{j}+\sum^{K}_{k=1}N_{k}+\sum^{L}_{l=1}N_{l}}{\left(\frac{c_{ft}\mathrm{Elev_{ft}}}{1000\left(c_{mi}\mathrm{Dist_{mi}}\right)}\right)}\right)$$
	$$\bullet\left(w_{S_{i}}\left(\sum^{I}_{i=1} \left(\frac{1}{\sum^{I}_{i=1}N_{i}}\right)V_{i}\right)+...+w_{S_{l}}\left(\sum^{L}_{l=1} \left(\frac{1}{\sum^{L}_{l=1}N_{l}}\right)V_{l}\right)\right)$$

	Where:\\
	$S_{R(A)}=$ Adjusted route score for given route $R$\\

	In English, this equation reads: ``number of tops (Munro, Munro Top, Corbett, Corbett Top) achieved on the route per vertical meter gained on the route, per horizontal meter gained on the route; scaled by the route type, route stages, terrain types, and terrain difficulty elements found on-route''.\\
